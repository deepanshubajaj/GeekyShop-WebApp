# GeekyShop Server

This is the backend for the **GeekyShop** project. It handles all the server-side logic, API routes, and communication with the frontend.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running the server, make sure you have **Node.js** installed. If not, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

You also need **npm** (Node Package Manager), which comes with Node.js.

## 🚀 To Run

```bash
    cd login_server
```
```bash
    npm install
```
```bash
    npm install -g nodemon  # Run once for local dev setup
```
```bash
    nodemon server.js       # For local development
```
```bash
    node server.js          # For production
```
